# Car Parking Management System

A full-stack, API-driven web application designed to streamline parking booking and management. This project features a relational SQL database, real-time occupancy visualisation, and accessibility-focused UI design.

## 🚀 Key Features (My Contributions)
This was a group project where I led the Backend Engineering and Quality Assurance. My specific contributions include:

* **Backend Architecture:** Designed the SQL relational database schema to handle complex relationships between Users, Vehicles, and Parking Slots.
* **Concurrency Handling:** Implemented SQL transaction locking to prevent "Double Booking" race conditions.
* **API Development:** Built the RESTful API endpoints connecting the frontend to the database.
* **Testing:** Designed and executed the testing strategy using Jest (100% pass rate).
* **Accessibility:** Implemented high-contrast modes and font-scaling for inclusivity.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Chart.js
* **Backend:** Node.js / Express (or Python/Flask - *change this to match your code*)
* **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL
* **Testing:** Jest

## 📂 Project Structure
* `/Database schema` - Contains the SQL structure and entity relationships.
* `/public` - Static assets and frontend logic.
* `server.js` - Main entry point for the application API.
